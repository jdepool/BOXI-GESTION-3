# Recent Changes (October 2025)

## Pagos Tab - Separate Action Columns (October 11, 2025)
- **Changed**: Replaced the single "Acciones" column with three separate columns: "Pago Inicial/Total", "Flete", and "Cuotas"
- **Implementation**:
  - Each action button now has its own dedicated column with centered alignment
  - Column widths: Pago Inicial/Total (150px), Flete (100px), Cuotas (100px)
  - Updated table colspan from 8 to 10 to accommodate the new structure
- **Impact**: Provides a cleaner, more organized layout that matches the look and feel of other tables in the application

## Pagos Tab - Fixed Wrong Order Data in Modals (October 11, 2025)
- **Fixed**: Clicking on an order row in the Pagos Tab now shows the correct order data in all modals (Pago Inicial/Total, Flete, Cuotas)
- **Issue**: Order #2386 was showing data from #2387 and other orders showed incorrect data
- **Root Cause**: The `#` symbol in order numbers was not being URL-encoded, causing the API to misinterpret the query parameter
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `encodeURIComponent()` to properly encode order numbers before API calls
  - Ensured all three modals (Pago Inicial, Flete, Cuotas) receive the correct `orden` value from the order object
- **Impact**: Users can now reliably access the correct order information from any modal in the Pagos Tab

## Notes Character Limit Increased (October 11, 2025)
- **Changed**: Increased the character limit for notes from 150 to 200 characters
- **Implementation**:
  - Updated `maxLength` attribute on notes input field from 150 to 200
  - Updated `handleNotesChange` validation to allow 200 characters
- **UI Behavior**:
  - Column width remains narrow (min-w-[150px]) to save table space
  - Long notes display truncated with ellipsis (...) in the table
  - Hovering over truncated notes shows the full text (up to 200 characters) in a tooltip
- **Impact**: Users can now write more detailed notes (50 characters more than before) while maintaining the compact table layout

# System Architecture

## Frontend
Built with React 18 and TypeScript, the frontend uses a single-page application architecture. Wouter handles client-side routing, and TanStack Query manages server state and caching. The UI is constructed with shadcn/ui components (based on Radix UI) styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring accessibility and customizability.

## Backend
The backend is a RESTful API built with Express.js and TypeScript. It features a modular structure with dedicated route handlers for sales, file uploads, and analytics. A storage abstraction layer separates business logic from data access. Multer middleware is used for processing Excel file uploads.

## Data Storage
PostgreSQL is the primary database, accessed via Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. Key tables include `users`, `sales`, and `upload_history`. Drizzle provides schema validation and type inference. Neon's serverless PostgreSQL client manages the database connection for optimal performance.

## Authentication
The system uses basic username/password authentication. User sessions are managed through PostgreSQL session storage using `connect-pg-simple` for secure server-side session management.

## UI/UX Design
The application utilizes shadcn/ui for consistent design patterns and accessibility, built upon Radix UI primitives. Tailwind CSS is used for rapid and responsive styling. Lucide React provides a consistent icon set. The design includes a redesigned dashboard with five financial payment tracking metrics: Total USD, Pago Inicial/Total, Total Cuotas, Total Pagado, and Pendiente.

## Feature Specifications
- **Sales Data Upload**: Supports Excel files from Cashea, Shopify, and Treble.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualizes sales metrics and financial payment tracking.
- **Sales Management**: Includes filtering, searching, and export capabilities for sales records. Notes field supports up to 200 characters with hover tooltip to view full text in truncated table display.
- **Delivery Status Tracking**: Monitors the status of product deliveries with nine distinct states (`Pendiente`, `Perdida`, `En proceso`, `A despachar`, `En tr√°nsito`, `Entregado`, `A devolver`, `Devuelto`, `Cancelada`).
- **Channel-Specific Metrics**: Provides insights tailored to different sales channels.
- **Multi-Product Order Handling**: Supports orders with multiple products, tracking both order-level and individual product totals.
- **Manual Sales & Reservations**: Allows for manual creation with integrated payment tracking and status updates. Includes a mandatory "Fecha de Entrega" field and consistent field ordering across forms.
- **Payment Management**: Features a Pago Inicial/Total modal with accurate total order USD display, installment tracking with `pagoCuotaUsd` field, and a Flete modal that displays SKU lists. Payment fields are clearly separated and renamed for better organization (e.g., `referenciaInicial`, `montoInicialBs`).
- **Bank Type Classification**: Differentiates between "Receptor" (receiving) and "Emisor" (issuing) banks, with payment forms filtering to show only "Receptor" banks.
- **Payment Date Tracking**: `fechaPagoInicial` field tracks the actual date Pago Inicial/Total was received, separate from the order creation date.
- **Chrome Autocomplete Suppression**: Implements unique autocomplete values to prevent unwanted autofill suggestions.
