# System Architecture

## Frontend
Built with React 18 and TypeScript, the frontend uses a single-page application architecture. Wouter handles client-side routing, and TanStack Query manages server state and caching. The UI is constructed with shadcn/ui components (based on Radix UI) styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring accessibility and customizability.

## Backend
The backend is a RESTful API built with Express.js and TypeScript. It features a modular structure with dedicated route handlers for sales, file uploads, and analytics. A storage abstraction layer separates business logic from data access. Multer middleware is used for processing Excel file uploads.

## Data Storage
PostgreSQL is the primary database, accessed via Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. Key tables include `users`, `sales`, and `upload_history`. Drizzle provides schema validation and type inference. Neon's serverless PostgreSQL client manages the database connection for optimal performance.

## Authentication
The system uses basic username/password authentication. User sessions are managed through PostgreSQL session storage using `connect-pg-simple` for secure server-side session management.

## UI/UX Design
The application utilizes shadcn/ui for consistent design patterns and accessibility, built upon Radix UI primitives. Tailwind CSS is used for rapid and responsive styling. Lucide React provides a consistent icon set.
