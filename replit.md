# Overview

BoxiSleep is a sales management system for a sleep products company, designed to streamline sales operations from data ingestion to analytics. It enables users to upload sales data, manage sales records with advanced filtering and export functionalities, track financial payments, and provides real-time analytics on sales performance, delivery status, and channel-specific metrics to empower informed business decisions. The system now supports multiple product lines including Boxi and Mompox products with separate workflow tracking through distinct sales channels (Shopify for Boxi, ShopMom for Mompox).

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Cargar Datos Implementation: Implemented as a settings/gear icon button positioned in the top-right of the tabs bar, opening a dialog with upload controls and automation settings. This separates administrative features from regular sales workflow tabs.
Address Form Organization: All address forms (Direcciones, Manual Sales, Manual Reserva) display Dirección de Despacho first, followed by a checkbox (checked by default) labeled "La dirección de facturación es igual a la de despacho". Dirección de Facturación fields appear below only when the checkbox is unchecked. When checked, shipping address changes automatically sync to billing address. Despacho fields are required; facturación fields are optional when addresses differ.
Reportes Organization: Reportes tab displays a dashboard with card-based layout where each report type is accessible via a dedicated button. Currently includes "Reporte temporal de Ordenes", "Ordenes Perdidas", and "Prospectos Perdidos" cards. This scalable structure allows easy addition of new report types as separate cards.
Status Badge Color System: Standardized color-coded badges across Ingresos and Egresos verification systems using shared utility functions in `client/src/lib/badge-utils.ts`. Consistent colors: Verificado (green), Por verificar/Pagado (amber), Rechazado (purple). Egresos-specific: Por Pagar (red), Por Autorizar (blue), Borrador (grey). All colors include dark mode variants. The "Pagado a" field (formerly "Beneficiario") identifies payee in egresos workflow.
Egresos Verification Table: Simplified interface in Verificación section displays only verification-essential columns: Fecha de pago, Monto Pagado Bs, Monto Pagado USD, Referencia, Banco, Estado (with colored badge), Notas. Verification dialog similarly streamlined to show only payment-relevant details. This focused design eliminates administrative fields (Tipo, Descripción, Pagado a) from the verification workflow.

# System Architecture

## UI/UX Design
The application features a React 18 and TypeScript frontend, using Wouter for routing and shadcn/ui components (based on Radix UI) styled with Tailwind CSS for an accessible and customizable user interface. The design emphasizes a tabbed structure for sales management, payment verification, and specialized pages, with administrative functions accessed via a dedicated settings icon. Date filtering is handled by a reusable `DateRangePicker`. The system includes two separate sales workflow pages: "Ventas" (for Boxi products) and "Ventas Mompox" (for Mompox products), each with identical tab structure (Prospectos, Inmediatas, Reservas, Pagos, Lista de Ventas) but filtered by their respective canal groups. Ventas Mompox uses the `canalMompox` filter to show orders where canal='ShopMom' OR canal contains 'MP' (Manual MP, Cashea MP, Tienda MP), while Ventas filters by specific Boxi channels (Shopify, Cashea, Manual, Tienda). Manual sales forms automatically pre-fill the canal field based on the parent page: "Manual MP" for Mompox orders, "Manual" for Boxi orders.

## Technical Implementations
The backend is a RESTful API built with Express.js and TypeScript, featuring a modular structure. PostgreSQL is the primary database, accessed via Drizzle ORM. Authentication uses basic username/password with PostgreSQL session storage. A critical date handling standard ensures all date-only fields are stored as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings, parsed using `parseLocalDate()`, and formatted using `formatDateOnly()` to prevent timezone issues. Canal values are normalized to canonical casing during upload ('shopmom' → 'ShopMom') to ensure consistent database storage and UI filtering.

**Order Search System**: Implements dual search modes to prevent historical order confusion. Backend `getSales()`, `getTotalSalesCount()`, and `getOrdersForPayments()` support three filter parameters with priority: `search` (partial match for user-typed queries), `ordenExacto` (exact match for loading specific orders in modals/forms), and `orden` (legacy partial match). Payment modals (Pago Inicial, Flete, Cuotas) and detail views use `ordenExacto` parameter to ensure short order numbers (e.g., "102") load correctly without returning orders with matching trailing digits (e.g., "48116102"). This prevents data mixing when aggregating multi-product orders by orden in the payments table.

**Dual Email System**: Order confirmation emails are sent from different email accounts based on product line. Mompox sales (ShopMom, Cashea MP, Manual MP, Tienda MP) use GoDaddy SMTP (hola@sofamompox.com via smtpout.secureserver.net:465 with nodemailer), while Boxi sales (Shopify, Cashea, Manual, Tienda) use Microsoft Outlook via Graph API. Credentials managed via Replit Secrets (GODADDY_EMAIL, GODADDY_PASSWORD). Email routing logic in `server/services/email-service.ts` detects canal and selects appropriate transport.

## Feature Specifications
- **Sales Data Upload & Management**: Excel uploads from multiple channels with replacement logic, filtering, searching, and export. Supports webhook integration for automated order ingestion from Shopify (Boxi products via `/api/webhooks/shopify`) and ShopMom (Mompox products via `/api/webhooks/shopify-mompox`).
- **Order & Payment Tracking**: Detailed tracking of sales, nine delivery statuses, multi-product orders, manual sales, and reservations. Includes payment verification, multi-currency support, and a centralized `Pendiente` (balance) calculation.
- **Delivery Workflow**: Channel-specific delivery status progression and management of returns and cancellations. Simplified filtering: Lista de Ventas excludes Pendiente/Perdida from dropdown and results; Inmediata/Reservas tables hide Estado Entrega filter completely (all orders are Pendiente); Pagos filter restricted to Pendiente/En Proceso only. Perdida orders accessible via dedicated report in Reportes dashboard with date filtering and Excel export. Return confirmation dialog requires mandatory selection of return type (Tipo Devolución) before confirming: either "101 noches" or "Garantía". The dialog resets selection state when closed (via cancel, backdrop click, or ESC) to prevent incorrect submissions.
- **Lead Management (Prospectos)**: Full lead tracking system with a 3-phase CRM follow-up workflow, automatic date calculations, and visual status tracking, including automated daily email reminders to asesores. Prospectos table always displays only active leads (estadoProspecto = 'Activo'). Perdido prospectos are excluded from the table view and are accessible via a dedicated report in Reportes dashboard with date filtering and Excel export. Convertido prospectos automatically transition to Pendiente estado when converted to orders.
- **Follow-Up Protocols (Protocolos de Seguimiento)**: Dual follow-up protocol system with separate configurations for Prospectos and Ordenes Pendientes. Each protocol independently configures 3-phase follow-up intervals (días between phases), asesor-specific email recipients (max 5), and general fallback email. Implemented via `seguimiento_config` table with `tipo` field ('prospectos' or 'ordenes'), unique constraint ensuring one config per type, and admin UI with two separate configuration cards. Both Inmediatas and Reservas tables now include Próximo column (showing next follow-up date with color-coded status) and Seguimiento button to track 3-phase follow-up for pending orders. Follow-up updates apply to all products in the same order simultaneously since the customer is the same.
- **Pricing & Cost Management**: Comprehensive system for tracking product prices (Inmediata, Reserva, Cashea) and unit costs in USD with effective dates, supporting multiple records per SKU, Excel uploads, and undo functionality. Dynamic Cashea pricing uses internal pricing for `totalUSD` calculation.
- **Product Classification System**: Flat tag-based classification system using a single `categorias` table with `tipo` field supporting four classification types: Marca, Categoría, Subcategoría, and Característica. Products associate with classifications via separate foreign keys (marcaId, categoriaId, subcategoriaId, caracteristicaId) with no enforced hierarchy. Admin UI provides type selector dropdown and filtering tabs for managing different classification types. Productos form displays separate dropdowns for each classification type, all optional. Legacy `categoria` text field retained for backward compatibility. Excel upload supports the new structure: accepts columns Producto (required), SKU, Marca, Categoría, Subcategoría, Característica (all optional), maps classification names to IDs via case-insensitive lookup, and provides clear error messages when classifications are not found in the system.
- **Estados and Ciudades Master Data**: Hierarchical address management system with 24 Venezuelan estados (including Distrito Capital) and 48 cities (capital + "Otra" for each estado). Implemented via `estados` and `ciudades` tables with foreign key relationship. All address forms (manual sales, manual reservas, prospectos, address management) use Select dropdowns instead of text inputs. Features smart filtering where ciudad dropdown shows only cities from selected estado, clears when estado changes, and disables until estado is selected. Implemented via reusable `useEstadosCiudades` hook with React Query caching. Data-testid attributes on SelectTrigger elements enable test automation. Backend provides REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on estados and ciudades data. Admin UI in "ESTADOS/CIUDADES" tab provides full CRUD management with touch-friendly controls for creating, editing, and deleting estados and their associated ciudades.
- **Automation**: Configurable automated Cashea order downloads and automatic assignment of payment details for Cashea sales.
- **Reporting**: Dashboard-based reporting system with card interface for accessing different report types. Reporte temporal de Ordenes provides comprehensive sales data with date filtering and Excel download. Ordenes Perdidas report provides detailed view of all lost orders with date filtering and Excel export. Prospectos Perdidos report provides detailed view of all lost prospects with follow-up information, date filtering, and Excel export. Navigation structure uses `/reportes` for dashboard, `/reportes/ordenes` for the orders report view, `/reportes/perdidas` for the lost orders report, and `/reportes/prospectos-perdidos` for the lost prospects report.
- **Order Numbering**: Separate order number ranges for manual (20000+) and Tienda (30000+) orders.
- **Accounts Payable (Egresos)**: Complete 4-stage workflow system for managing company expenses with registration, authorization, payment recording, and verification. Features smart form submission with dual-button system: "Guardar Borrador" saves incomplete entries as drafts, while "Enviar" (enabled only when required fields are complete) automatically transitions egresos to the appropriate next stage based on the "Requiere Autorización" checkbox. Required fields for submission: at least one amount field (Cuenta por Pagar USD OR Bs), Fecha de Compromiso, and Tipo de Egreso. Workflow stages: Borrador → Por Autorizar (if authorization required) or Por Pagar (if no authorization needed) → Por verificar → Verificado/Rechazado. The "Por Autorizar" tab filters to show only egresos with requiere_aprobacion=true. The "Por verificar" tab shows egresos with estado "Por verificar" OR "Rechazado", allowing rejected payments to be edited and reverified. When a rejected egreso is edited, it automatically returns to "Por verificar" status. Draft list provides edit and delete controls without redundant submission buttons. **Correlative Number System**: Each egreso is automatically assigned a unique correlative number (numeroEgreso) starting from 1001 when submitted (not while in draft). The number is generated automatically via `getNextNumeroEgreso()` in storage layer and displayed prominently in the "Egreso" column at the start of all workflow tables (Por Autorizar, Por Pagar, Por Verificar, Lista de Egresos) and in the form header when editing. This facilitates egreso identification, especially useful for tracking partial payments when invoice numbers don't exist. Tab renamed from "Historial Completo" to "Lista de Egresos" for clarity.
